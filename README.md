# resume-app

A not-so-simple iOS app to showcase Swift development skills using Xcode.

## Prerequisite 

1. Install swiftLint. [Instructions](at https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)

## Notes
This app is organized in a way that SOLID principles are respected. For example, separation of concerns is applied in `UITableView`s by implementing a class that takes care of their data source. In the future, I will be adding unit tests so that it can be shown how the code is written in a testable way.
